# Night Of The Living Plotters

A dump of some of my weird plotter related stuff, including:

- **plotraits.sh**, a bash script for automatic portrait generation written during the italian 2012 Hackmeeting. Goes all the way from a raster image to a ready-to-plot hpgl file. It also supports direct portrait generation from webcam input. How cool is that?

- **space_invaders.py**, python software written for the "Alien Victory Boogie Woogie" installation, as shown at the 2011 [Insert Coin exhibition] (http://insertcoin.verdebinario.org/alien-victory-boogie-woogie/)

- **schotter.py**, python reconstruction of the 1965(?) historical plotter art ["Schotter"] (http://www.medienkunstnetz.de/works/schotter/) by Georg Nees.

- **schotter.py**, python reconstruction of the 1975 historical plotter art ["Boxes"] (http://dada.compart-bremen.de/item/artwork/938) by William Kolomyjec.


*NOTE: installation instructions and/or software dependencies are described at the beginning of each file.*
